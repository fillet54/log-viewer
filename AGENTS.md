# HTML Log Viewer
This project is a HTML log view.

## Libraries

I am building tools for an offline environment so the following tooling
needs to be stuck with. We can use CDNs in this context to make things
easier.

* flask
* waitress
* htmx
* splitjs
* chartjs
* tailwindcss
* daisyui
* heroicons
